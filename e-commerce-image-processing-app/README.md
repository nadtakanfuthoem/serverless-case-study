üõçÔ∏è Scenario: E-Commerce Image Processing App
<img src="/e-commerce-image-processing-app/">

Use Case:
You run an e-commerce platform where vendors upload product images. You want to automatically resize these images into multiple sizes (thumbnail, medium, large) for responsive display on different devices.

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Image uploads via a frontend

Automatic resizing of images into various dimensions

Storage of original and resized images

Metadata logging (e.g., upload time, dimensions)

Low cost and scalable to handle traffic spikes during sales

üèóÔ∏è Serverless Architecture
Component	Technology
Image Upload Trigger	Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Compute Logic	AWS Lambda (Image Resizer Function)
Storage	Amazon S3 (for resized images)
Metadata Logging	Amazon DynamoDB or S3 metadata, or Amazon RDS (serverless)
Notification (optional)	Amazon SNS or SES (notify vendors of success/failure)
API Access (optional)	Amazon API Gateway

üß† Flow of Events
Vendor uploads an image to an S3 bucket (/uploads folder).

S3 triggers an event that invokes an AWS Lambda function.

Lambda:

Retrieves the image

Resizes it into different dimensions

Stores resized versions in another S3 folder (/thumbnails, /medium, /large)

Logs metadata to DynamoDB or another database

Optional: Sends a notification to the vendor (via email/SMS)

‚úÖ Why Serverless?
No server management: Lambda and S3 handle scaling and availability.

Cost-efficient: You only pay when files are uploaded (compute and storage).

Auto-scalable: Can handle thousands of image uploads per second during peak times.
